# Generated: 2026-01-24

## Summary
- Status: INITIAL GENERATION (no previous codemaps existed)
- Change Percentage: N/A (first generation)
- Files Created: 4

## Generated Files
1. codemaps/architecture.md - Overall architecture (170 lines)
2. codemaps/backend.md - Backend structure (163 lines)
3. codemaps/frontend.md - Frontend structure (222 lines)
4. codemaps/data.md - Data models and schemas (354 lines)

## Codebase Analysis
- Total Python Source Files: 78 (excluding tests)
- Services: 14 modules
- Agents: 7 modules
- UI Pages: 9 routes
- Memory/Data Models: 9 modules
- Utility Modules: 14 modules

## Architecture Highlights
- Clean architecture with Service Container DI pattern
- Multi-agent system: Interviewer → Architect → Writer → Editor → Continuity
- NiceGUI web frontend with path-based routing
- SQLite + NetworkX hybrid storage for world building
- Pydantic models for type-safe data handling
- Ollama integration for local LLM inference

## Key Patterns Documented
1. ServiceContainer dependency injection
2. AppState centralized UI state
3. BaseAgent with retry logic and rate limiting
4. WorldDatabase thread-safe SQLite operations
5. StoryOrchestrator workflow coordination
6. Prompt registry for template management

## No Approval Required
This is the initial generation of codemaps. No previous version exists for comparison.
