  Start the interview by warmly greeting the user and asking about their story idea.
  Ask 3-4 initial questions covering:
  1. What's the basic premise or concept they have in mind?
  2. What genre are they interested in?
  3. Any specific setting or time period?
  4. How long should the story be (short story, novella, or novel)?

  Keep it friendly and conversational. Do NOT ask about language upfront - you'll infer it from how they write.
